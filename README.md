Practice implementing a CNN on the MNIST dataset - test out dropout vs. no dropout

November 11, 2020

A Convolutional Neural Network that learns to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST data set

I am using this as a simple practice project for implementing a CNN and comparing the results of different architectures and hyperparameters.

I referred to the following youtube video for getting the basics up and running:

I also borrowed from the lecture slides from Coursera's ASU:CSE 571 - Artificial Intelligence lecture video - week 5, Video: Identifying Digits with a CNN.

The comparison between the two models did not turn out as expected.
